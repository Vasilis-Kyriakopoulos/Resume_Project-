    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <hr>
        Currently working as a Backend Software Engineer, focusing on COBOL development within the lending
        domain of Alpha Bank’s banking systems. Responsible for implementing and maintaining robust software
        solutions tailored to the specific needs of banking institution. I collaborate with cross-functional teams
        throughout the development lifecycle to ensure seamless integration, system reliability, and optimal performance.
   
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <hr>
        Bachelor of Science , Universiry of Peloponnese, Tripoli Greece. <br/>
        Major in Informatics and Telecommunications.<br/>
        GPA: 7.81
 
    <h2>Professional Projects – Accenture</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Contributing to the design and development of a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) solution—a service that
            allows customers to make purchases via debit card and pay in interest-free installments. To overcome legacy
            lending system constraints and ensure 24/7 service availability, we created a dedicated operational database
            that remains online at all times. Transactions are recorded there immediately and then asynchronously
            synchronized to the core legacy lending database. This decoupled, store-and-forward–style architecture
            guarantees continuous service uptime and seamless performance.(10/2024) - today
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed an internal reconciliation tool to validate the consistency of accounting records within the
            lending domain. The tool identifies known error patterns by analyzing data mismatches and writes detailed
            error logs to structured tables and output files. This project improved the traceability of transactional
            discrepancies and streamlined issue diagnosis for backend teams. (06/2024) - (10/2024)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>University Projects</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a comprehensive system comprising both client and server components for a car wash service.
            The system's primary functions include order reception, order storage, and issuance of receipts to customers.
        </li>
        <li>
             Designed and implemented a Hadoop MapReduce program tailored for executing complex queries on
            extensive datasets. The program effectively partitions large datasets into manageable chunks, processes
            each segment in parallel, and aggregates the results, significantly enhancing processing speed and efficiency
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed a cryptographic algorithm in Python and conducted a thorough cryptanalysis to assess its
            security and vulnerability levels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Designed and developed a dynamic web application using XAMPP, featuring a server-side component and
            MySQL database. The application incorporates essential functionalities including user authentication with
            login and sign-up modules, along with a profile editing feature.
